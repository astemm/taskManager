The TaskManager Application implemented as Spring Boot server(Spring Data MongoDb). Its frontend realized on the basis of Angular and Bootstrap. This application allows Users to add, edit, delete, browse, and share the tasks by users emails. All users can manage shared tasks. That is why underlying JWT authentication uses the same User role, so no authorization is present (just register and signin functionality).
There are three collections in Mongo NoSQL database: users, tasks, shared tasks. Task and SharedTasks model classes have nested User and Task objects accordingly, indeed it could be changed to use just reference ids, as in case of User entity, that has list of ids of own created tasks.
The concrete list of all tasks assigned to specific users is combined by list of own tasks and shared tasks (retrived by receiving user id from relevant db collection).
There is also additional functionality to auto-update of user tasklist, after sharing new task from other user, that is based on the ServerSentEvents (Sseemiiter), handled by EventSource on the client side. There the receiving userid as server event data and current user id are compared, and getall request to server is made in case of these ids equality.
